A set of Visual Studio projects I use to create a Tridion environment from Scratch. Current features:

  * Creates diamond blueprint
  * Creates some default schemas and content
  * Creates websites, webservices and deployers based on configuration parameters and sample configuration files
  * Imports content from RSS (and creates pages for this content)
